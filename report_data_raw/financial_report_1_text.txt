    1 Liberty Mutual Insurance Reports Second Quarter 2024 Results  
 
BOSTON, Mass., Augus t 7, 2024 � Liberty Mutual Holding Company Inc. and its subsidiaries (collectively �LMHC� 
or the �Company�) reported net income attributable to LMHC of  $717 million  and $2.252  billion for the three  and six  
months ended  June 30, 2024, versus a net loss attributable to LMHC of $ 585 million  and $660  million  for the same 
periods  in 2023 . 
 
�For the second quarter, we reported net income attributable to LMHC of $717 million, reflecting continued 
improvement in our underlying combined ratio and strong investment results,� said Tim Sweeney, Liberty Mutual 
President & Chief Executive Officer. �Our underlying combined ratio improved 9.5 points from the prior year to 
84.0%. Of that, 7.1 points of improvement resulted from our targeted underwriting strategie s improving both personal 
and commercial lines. In addition, our ongoing expense management program contributed 2.4 points of expense ratio 
improvement, driving it down to 26.4% for the second quarter and half year. Catastrophe losses in the quarter remained 
elevated, despite improving over prior year, attributable primarily to severe convective storm activity in the US 
Midwest. Including catastrophes and prior year development, the total combined ratio was 99.6% for the quarter, a 
9.8-point improvement ove r prior year. In addition, investment results in the quarter were strong, benefiting from 
higher reinvestment rates and favorable private equity valuations, which contributed to $1.3 billion of net investment 
income.�

3 The combined ratio, expressed as a percentage, is a measure of underwriting profitability.  This measure should only be used in conjunction 
with, and not in lieu of, underwriting income and may not be comparable to other performance measures used by the Company�s 
competitors.  The combined ratio is computed  as the sum of the following property and casualty ratios: the ratio of claims and claim 
adjustment expense less managed care income to earned premium; the ratio of insurance operating costs plus amortization of de ferred 
policy acquisition costs less third -party administration income and fee income (primarily related to the Company�s involuntary market 
servicing carrier operations) and installment charges to earned premium; and the ratio of policyholder dividends to earned pr emium. 
Provisions for uncollecti ble premium and reinsurance are not included in the combined ratio unless related to an asbestos and environmental 
commutation and certain other run off.  Restructuring and acquisition and integration costs are not included in the combined ratio.
