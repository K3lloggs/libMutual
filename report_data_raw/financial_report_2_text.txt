Liberty Mutual President & Chief Executive Officer. “Underwriting results continue to improve, with a 2. 8 point 
improvement in the underlying loss ratio to 62. 1% for the first quarter driven by rate execution and other underwriting 
actions. Catastrophe losses were in line wi th expectations for the quarter and improved 2.3 points  from the prior year. 
In total, the loss ratio improved 5.9 points to 69.5%. Our US Retail Markets segment saw 5.2 points of improvement 
in the underlying loss ratio compared to the prior year driven by targeted rate actions continuing to earn in and 
favorable frequency trends. Despite higher current year large loss activity, Global Risk Solutions total combined ratio 
improved 3.9 points from the prior year to 9 4.2%. Our ongoing expense management program drove a 2.5 point 
reduction in the consolidated expense ratio to 26.3%. Overall, it was a strong quarter and we are pleased with the solid 
progress we continue to make on profit improvement as we march towards our 95% combined ratio target in 2025. ”

2 The combined ratio, expressed as a percentage, is a measure of underwriting profitability.  This measure should only be used in conjunction 
with, and not in lieu of, underwriting income and may not be comparable to other performance measures used by the Company’s 
competitors.  The combined ratio is computed as the sum  of the following property and casualty ratios: the ratio of claims and claim 
adjustment expense less managed care income to earned premium; the ratio of insurance operating costs plus amortization of deferred policy acquisition costs less third -party administration income and fee income (primarily related to the Company’s involuntary market 
servicing carrier operations) and installment charges to earned premium; and the ratio of policyholder dividends to earned pr emium. 
Provisions for uncollectible premium  and reinsurance are not included in the combined ratio unless related to an asbestos and environmental 
commutation and certain other run off.  Restructuring and acquisition and integration costs are not included in the combined ratio.
