 1Liberty Mutual Insurance Reports First Quarter 2023 Results 
BOSTON, Mass., May 11, 2023 – Liberty Mutual Holding Company Inc. and its subsidiaries (collectively “LMHC” 
or the “Company”) reported net loss attributable to LMHC of $74 million for the three months ended March 31, 2023, 
versus net income attributable to LMHC of $498 million for the same periods in 2022. 
“For the first quarter, we reported net losses attributable to LMHC of $74 million, primarily due to elevated catastrophe 
losses largely driven by severe weather storms across the Midwest,” said Tim Sweeney, Liberty Mutual President & 
Chief Executive Officer. “Excluding catastrophes, inflation continues to weigh on underlying personal lines results as 
parts, materials, and labor costs have remained high. Given this elevated loss trend environment, we have continued 
pushing for rate and have achieved premium renewal rate increases of 12.8% in U.S. Personal Lines over the last 12 
months. Also in the quarter, our Global Risk Solutions business demonstrated progress toward our previously stated 
combined ratio targets with a total combined ratio of 97.5%, a 2.2-point improvement from the first quarter 2022.”

2 The combined ratio, expressed as a percentage, is a measure of underwriting profitability.  This measure should only be used in conjunction 
with, and not in lieu of, underwriting income and may not be comparable to other performance measures used by the Company’s 
competitors.  The combined ratio is computed as the sum of the following property and casualty ratios: the ratio of claims and claim 
adjustment expense less managed care income to earned premium; the ratio of insurance operating costs plus amortization of deferred 
policy acquisition costs less third-party administration income and fee income (primarily related to the Company’s involuntary market 
servicing carrier operations) and installment charges to earned premium; and the ratio of policyholder dividends to earned premium. 
Provisions for uncollectible premium and reinsurance are not included in the combined ratio unless related to an asbestos and environmental 
commutation and certain other run off.  Restructuring and acquisition and integration costs are not included in the combined ratio.
