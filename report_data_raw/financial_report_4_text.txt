    1 Liberty Mutual Insurance Reports Second Quarter 2023 Results 
 
BOSTON, Mass., August 9, 202 3 – Liberty Mutual Holding Company Inc. and its subsidiaries (collectively “LMHC” 
or th e “Company”) reported net loss attributable to LMHC of  $585  million  and $660 million for the three  and six 
months ended June 30, 2023 , versus net loss attributable to LMHC of $343  million  and income of $155 million for 
the same period s in 2022 . 
 
“During and subsequent to the quarter end, we announced key organizational changes and executive leadership 
appointments aimed at enhancing focus on long- term strategic markets, while better leveraging scale advantages to 
drive target profitability and sustainable success,” said Tim Sweeney, Liberty Mutual President & Chief Executive Officer. “We have announced agreements to divest our GRM West operations in Europe and Latin America, and our 
GRS Liberty Specialty Markets direct insurance business operations in Brazil, Chile, and Colombia. This allows us 
to elevate our US -focused personal and small commercial business into a standalone business unit, called US Retai l 
Markets or (USRM) and consolidate our international operations under one umbrella in Global Risk Solutions.”  
 
“For the second quarter, we reported a net loss attributable to LMHC of $585 million, primarily driven by elevated 
catastrophe losses from wides pread wind and hail events in Texas, Oklahoma, and Colorado,” said Sweeney. “We 
have and continue to take rate and underwriting action to address the inflationary pressures in personal lines felt across the industry, resulting in a 4.7-point improvement in the underlying loss ratio in our Global Retail Markets 
business in the quarter. Despite elevated catastrophes, our Global Risk Solutions business is continuing to drive progress towards our combined ratio targets with improvement in the underlying loss ra tio of 0.4pts in the quarter.”

3 The combined ratio, expressed as a percentage, is a measure of underwriting profitability.  This measure should only be used in conjunction 
with, and not in lieu of, underwriting income and may not be comparable to other performance measures used by the Company’s 
compe titors.  The combined ratio is computed as the sum of the following property and casualty ratios: the ratio of claims and cla im 
adjustment expense less managed care income to earned premium; the ratio of insurance operating costs plus amortization of de ferred 
policy acquisition costs less third -party administration income and fee income (primarily related to the Company’s involuntary market 
servicing carrier operations) and installment charges to earned premium; and the ratio of policyholder dividends to ea rned premium. 
Provisions for uncollectible premium and reinsurance are not included in the combined ratio unless related to an asbestos and environmental 
commutation and certain other run off.  Restructuring and acquisition and integration costs are not included in the combined ratio.
