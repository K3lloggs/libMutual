 
    1 Liberty Mutual Insurance Reports Third Quarter 2023 Results  
 
BOSTON, Mass., November 9, 202 3 – Liberty Mutual Holding Company Inc. and its subsidiaries (collectively 
“LMHC” or th e “Company”) reported net income attributable to LMHC of  $219 million  and loss of $441 million for 
the three  and nine months ended  September 30, 2023, versus net loss attributable to LMHC of $ 353 million  and $ 198 
million for the same period s in 202 2. 
 
“For the third quarter, we reported net income attributable to LMHC of $219 million,” said Tim Sweeney, Liberty 
Mutual President & Chief Executive Officer. “Solid underwriting results in our Global Risk Solutions business and 
the tailwind from rising net i nvestment income helped offset continued pressure from inflation and severe weather 
impacting US personal lines. Despite these challenges, the underlying combined ratio in US Retail Markets improved 
2.4 points and we continue to take aggressive rate and no n-rate actions to return that business to target profitability. 
Global Risk Solutions continues to make progress toward its targets, with an improvement in the underlying combined 
ratio of 2.2 points compared to the prior year quarter. We remain focused on  continuing to improve underwriting 
profitability to achieve a 95% target combined ratio.”  
 
The tables below outline highlights of LMHC’s  consolidated financial results for the three and nine months ended

3 The combined ratio, expressed as a percentage, is a measure of underwriting profitability.  This measure should only be used in conjunction 
with, and not in lieu of, underwriting income and may not be comparable to other performance measures used by the Co mpany’s 
competitors.  The combined ratio is computed as the sum of the following property and casualty ratios: the ratio of claims an d claim 
adjustment expense less managed care income to earned premium; the ratio of insurance operating costs plus amortiza tion of deferred 
policy acquisition costs less third -party administration income and fee income (primarily related to the Company’s involuntary market 
servicing carrier operations) and installment charges to earned premium; and the ratio of policyholder di vidends to earned premium. 
Provisions for uncollectible premium and reinsurance are not included in the combined ratio unless related to an asbestos and  environmental 
commutation and certain other run off.  Restructuring and acquisition and integration cos ts are not included in the combined ratio.
