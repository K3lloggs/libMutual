660 million for the three  and six 
months ended June 30, 2023 
During and subsequent to the quarter end, we announced key organizational changes and executive leadership 
appointments aimed at enhancing focus on long
 term strategic markets, while better leveraging scale advantages to 
drive target profitability and sustainable success
 said Tim Sweeney, Liberty Mutual President 
We have announced agreements to divest our GRM West operations in Europe and Latin America, and our 
GRS Liberty Specialty Markets direct insurance business operations in Brazil
 Chile, and Colombia. This allows us 
to elevate our US 
focused personal and small commercial business into a standalone business unit, called US Retai l 
Markets or (USRM) and consolidate our international operations under one umbrella in Global Risk Solutions.
For the second quarter, we reported a net loss attributable to LMHC of 
585 million, primarily driven by elevated 
catastrophe losses from wides pread wind and hail events in Texas
 Oklahoma, and Colorado
We 
have and continue to take rate and underwriting action to address the inflationary pressures in personal lines felt across the industry, resulting in a 4.7
 Despite elevated catastrophes, our Global Risk Solutions business is continuing to drive progress towards our combined ratio targets with improvement in the underlying loss ra tio of 0.4pts in the quarter.
